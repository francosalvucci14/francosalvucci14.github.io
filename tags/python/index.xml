    <description><![CDATA[Abstract My undergraduate thesis work focuses on a particular class of graphs, namely temporal graphs. A temporal graph $G=(V,E)$ is a graph where each arc $(u,v)\in E$ is associated with a list of timestamps, which indicate the instants of time in which the arc is active.
My work was to find an efficient algorithm that solves the problem of Temporal Connectivity, that is, to determine whether a given temporal graph with a tree topology is temporally connected or not.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Idea The idea for this project came from a classmate of mine, Simone Zheng.
The idea is to create a scraper that goes to analyze and “study” the data on real estate sites, so as to be able to analyze the various listings, selected by area, and calculate which among the houses/apartments for sale is worth buying and which ones are better not to look at at all
Currently, all the functions that are concerned with calculating which among the listings is the best, based on average salary, IRPEF and tc , are still under development]]></description>
