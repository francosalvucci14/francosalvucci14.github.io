I am a student of the Faculty of Computer Science at Tor Vergata University I have always been passionate about the world of programming and information technology in general (both on the software and hardware side, but more so on software üòÑ) I love experimenting with new technologies (like this one here, aka Hugo) and always try new design/programming/etc challenges‚Ä¶ Currently I am particularly interested in the world of Algorithms, in fact I will probably focus my thesis on this (but for now let‚Äôs leave out this detail, there‚Äôs still a lot of time to think about that‚Ä¶) P.S : Take a look at the post I made on university, where I tell my personal experience, my doubts, my fears and my advice for newly enrolled students -\u003e University I don‚Äôt know what else to say, so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs okay Skills These are my skills: Languages I know: C# Python Java C ///JQuery (a little bit) LaTeX SQL Markdown IDE I use: Visual Studio Code Visual Studio 2019 Ecplise SQL developer (YES I know it‚Äôs not an IDE, but a GUI interface to the Oracle Database, but I don‚Äôt care üòÑ) Other: NeoVim Git GitHub I‚Äôm also learning to use linux via the Pop!_os operating system Photo of me Link qui My project I created various software, so in my lost time, which allowed me to deepen my knowledge of various languages (C# and SQL in particular) here they are: FlappyBird C# Version developed in C# and SQL Blood Bank Management System App developed in C# and SQL Bank App developed in Java CryptoTool developed in C# PortScanner developed in Java (it only works locally, of course) Oh,yeah‚Ä¶ Yeah, I forgot PHP, but let‚Äôs face it, who the f*ck likes PHP, let‚Äôs be real (But yeah, I know PHP too) ","date":"2023-03-04","objectID":"/aboutme/:0:0","tags":["Me","Biografy"],"title":"About me","uri":"/aboutme/"}]
