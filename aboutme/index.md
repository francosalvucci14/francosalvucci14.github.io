# About me

# Me
Hi, I'm Salvucci Franco.
I am a student of the Faculty of Computer Science at Tor Vergata University

I have always been passionate about the world of programming and information technology in general (both on the software and hardware side, but more so on software :))

I love experimenting with new technologies (like this one here, aka Hugo)
and always try new design/programming/etc challenges...

Currently I am particularly interested in the world of Algorithms, in fact I will probably focus my thesis on this

# Skills

# My project

I created various software, so in my lost time, which allowed me to deepen my knowledge of various languages (C# and SQL in particular)
here they are:

- [FlappyBird C# Version](https://github.com/francosalvucci14/FlappyBird-CS)
- [Blood Bank Management System App](https://github.com/francosalvucci14/BloodBank_ManagementSystem)
- [Bank App](https://github.com/francosalvucci14/Bank-App)

# Oh,yeah...

Yeah, I forgot PHP, but let's face it, who the f*ck likes PHP, let's be real
(But yeah, I know PHP too)

{{< typeit code=java >}}
public class PHPSuck {
    public static void main(String []args) {
        System.out.println("PHP suck");
    }
}
{{< /typeit >}}
