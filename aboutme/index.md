# About me

# Me
Hi, I'm Salvucci Franco.

I am a student of the Faculty of Computer Science at Tor Vergata University

I have always been passionate about the world of programming and information technology in general (both on the software and hardware side, but more so on software :smile:)

I love experimenting with new technologies (like this one here, aka Hugo)
and always try new design/programming/etc challenges...

Currently I am particularly interested in the world of Algorithms, in fact I will probably focus my thesis on this (but for now let's leave out this detail, there's still a lot of time to think about that...)<br/>
**P.S** : Take a look at the post I made on university, where I tell my personal experience, my doubts, my fears and my advice for newly enrolled students -> [University]({{< ref "posts/UniversitÃ .md" >}})

I don't know what else to say, so I'd say that's okay

# Oh,yeah...

Yeah, I forgot PHP, but let's face it, who the f*ck likes PHP, let's be real
(But yeah, I know PHP too)

{{< typeit code=java >}}
public class PHPSuck {
    public static void main(String []args) {
        System.out.println("PHP suck");
    }
}
